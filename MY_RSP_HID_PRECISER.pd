#X text 300 38 18th October 2018 I found that the hid-object \; is
a little bit unprecise in reading the turns of my self-built HID-controller's
endless knobs. \; When I turn a knob \, the value detection \; sometimes
works ok: press: 1----0 But sometimes ONE turn is recognized as \;
TWO turns: \; press: 1-1-0-0 So this patch acts as a filter \; and
only lets a number come through \; when the number before was not the
same \; as the current number. \; The Moses object at the bottom lets
only the value 1 \; pass to the output.;
